# Project 5: Picture Purrfect
### *Capturing the best moment of your furry friend with computer vision*


###### Metis Passion Project

## Introduction

It's not always easy to take photos for animals!  
Instead of taking a bunch of photos, just upload a short video and let **Picture Purffect** pick the best frame for your cat! The algorithm involves different levels of computer vision (image processing, cascade face detection, custom trained object detection with YOLOv3 darknet) and random forest classifier.
